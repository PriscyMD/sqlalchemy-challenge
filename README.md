# sqlalchemy-challenge

## An overview of the project and its purpose
### Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task.

## Instructions on how to use and interact with the project
### Part 1 Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
- In this section, you’ll use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, you’ll use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

### Part 2 Design Your Climate App
- Now that you’ve completed your initial analysis, you’ll design a Flask API based on the queries that you just developed.
  
## At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project
- At the beginning everything was fine since most of the 1st part came in the exercises of the class, from the second day of class there were similar codes and from there I started to loose the activities to be able to advance to the next step of FlaskAPI, with similar exercises on the third day of class, when I did not know what to write or did not understand the code, I deepened with BlackBox.ai each part of the code.
